  ],
  "ai_analysis": [
    {
      "question": "How does the AI analysis work?",
      "answer": "ACTMS uses machine learning algorithms, specifically Isolation Forest for anomaly detection. The AI analyzes bid patterns, submission timing, proposal content, bid amounts, and other factors to identify potentially suspicious activities. The system learns from historical data to improve detection accuracy."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an anomaly score?",
      "answer": "An anomaly score is a numerical value indicating how unusual a bid appears compared to normal patterns. Scores typically range from -1 to 1, where lower scores indicate more anomalous behavior. Bids with very low scores (typically below -0.1) are flagged as suspicious for further review."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate is the AI detection?",
      "answer": "The AI system's accuracy improves with more data. It's designed with a 10% contamination rate, meaning it expects about 10% of bids to be anomalous. The system provides explanations for its decisions and should be used as a tool to assist human reviewers, not replace human judgment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I improve my anomaly score?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can improve your score by: submitting detailed, well-written proposals (50+ words), bidding reasonable amounts relative to estimated values, maintaining consistent company information, submitting during business hours, and demonstrating genuine engagement with tender requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "What triggers a suspicious bid alert?",
      "answer": "Alerts are triggered by: bids with very low anomaly scores, unusual timing patterns, bid amounts significantly different from estimated values, very short or generic proposals, inconsistent company information, or patterns that deviate significantly from normal bidding behavior."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often is the AI model updated?",
      "answer": "The AI model can be retrained anytime through the AI Analysis page when sufficient new data is available (minimum 10 bids). Regular retraining helps the model adapt to new patterns and improve accuracy. The system administrator can initiate retraining as needed."
